# Contact Us Plugin - TODO & Next Features

## üìã Current Usage

### Shortcode Options
```php
[contact_us_form]  // Basic usage with default settings
[contact_us_form title="Custom Title"]  // Custom title
[contact_us_form hide_title="true"]  // Hide title completely
[contact_us_form show_phone="false"]  // Hide phone field
[contact_us_form show_subject="false"]  // Hide subject field
[contact_us_form title="Get in Touch" show_phone="true" show_subject="true"]  // Combined options
```

### Smart Title Detection
The plugin automatically detects if you're on a contact-related page and hides the form title to avoid duplication:
- If page title contains "Contact", "Contact Us", "Get in Touch", etc. ‚Üí Form title is hidden
- If `hide_title="true"` ‚Üí Form title is always hidden
- If custom title is specified ‚Üí Custom title is always shown

### Example Use Cases
- **Contact page with main heading**: Use `[contact_us_form hide_title="true"]`
- **General page**: Use `[contact_us_form]` (title will show if appropriate)
- **Custom branding**: Use `[contact_us_form title="Reach Out to Us"]`
